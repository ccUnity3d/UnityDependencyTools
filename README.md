# UnityDependencyTools
In Unity editor, you can get assets' dependency via context menu `Select Dependencies` conveniently. **BUT the opposite operation is quite difficult**, sometimes you need to search for guid in the entire repo. This is quite inconvenient and that's why I made this tool.

UnityDependencyTool gives you the context menu `Select Dependencies By`,  so you can trace every asset's dependencies forward and reversly.

And even more, you can got one asset's directly dependencies via other context menus as you want.

The context menu is as below:
